CRUISE (Context Recognition, Urban Sensing and Intelligence) research group, led by Dr. Salim, meets weekly to discuss research ideas and papers in A*/A journal and conferences in ubiquitous computing, data mining, spatio-temporal and time-series data analysis, knowledge discovery, machine learning, and pattern recognition from sensor data. Members include current PhD students and their co-supervisors, and postdocs. We share our codes and some sample datasets in our [CRUISE GitHub repository](https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup).
