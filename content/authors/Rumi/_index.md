Short Bio: I have received the BSc. degree in Computer Science from Khula University of Engineering and Technology (KUET), Bangladesh. I have submitted my dissertation for the examination of PhD degree at RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia under the supervision of A/Prof. Flora Salim and Dr. Ke Deng. Currently, I am working as an intern at Royal Australian Air Force. My research interests include spatiotemporal data mining, Mobility analysis, and urban dynamics. I love my tea with extra milk and sugar.
